                Procurement law has become increasingly useful and important in modern day practice in relation to
                public expenditure.

                We provide a number of services towards this regard which include advising clients on procurement
                law, prosecuting and defending clients before the relevant board/ tribunals established under the
                relevant procurement law.

                Among the cases successfully litigated in Procurement Law include the award of tender for the
                construction of Hospitality Buildings at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies by CHINA WU YI LIMITED
